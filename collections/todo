linkedlist is not multithread safe, in what situation it will fail?

dequeue on linkedlist

in map, keyset and valueset is not a view but backed by real stuff, changes to these sets will change the map

hashmap allows null key but treemap doesn't
hashmap is array backed
when hashmap is getting too large, it will be transformed to be backed by a tree, similar to treemap
linkedhashmap perserves the insert order, (can be configured as insert order), can automatically remove elements based on fixed size
iterations on linkedhashmap will skip empty buckets

iterate hashmap will cover the capacity, linkedhashmap does not have this problem
